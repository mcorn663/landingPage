# landingPage


This project was an Odin Project Landing Page Assignment. The goal was to made a landing page that matches a model provided, while using your own content. 

This project required basic web developement and design skills, including: 
- imgages and buttons,
- flexbox and nested flexbox,
- and, css variables.

This was a fun project and even better because I could show off my pup!
